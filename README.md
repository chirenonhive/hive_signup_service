# Hive Signup Service

A Node.js service that handles Hive blockchain account creation with support for both free and paid account tiers. This service integrates with the Hive blockchain and Transak payment gateway to provide a seamless account creation experience.

## Important Note

ðŸš§ **Proof of Concept** ðŸš§

This is a proof-of-concept implementation of a Hive account creation service. While it demonstrates the basic functionality, please note:

- This is experimental code meant for learning and demonstration purposes
- It hasn't been thoroughly tested in production environments
- You should review and test the code before using it in any serious projects
- The code handles cryptocurrency transactions - always test with small amounts first!
- Feel free to modify, improve, and build upon this code for your needs

We'd love to see how you use and improve this project, but remember: cryptocurrencies involve real money, so always double-check everything and proceed with caution! 

## Features

- Dual account creation modes:
  - Free accounts with verification
  - Paid accounts with cryptocurrency payment support
- Real-time HIVE price tracking via CoinGecko API
- Secure payment processing through Transak
- Configurable pricing and safety limits
- SQLite database for transaction tracking
- Multiple Hive node failover support

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- NPM or Yarn
- Basic understanding of the Hive blockchain
- Transak API credentials (for paid accounts)

- `500 Internal Server Error`: Server error

## Database Schema

The service uses SQLite with the following schema for pending accounts:

```sql
CREATE TABLE pending_accounts (
    reference_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    username TEXT UNIQUE,
    account_type TEXT,
    status TEXT,
    verification_code TEXT,
    payment_amount_usd DECIMAL(10,2),
    payment_amount_hive DECIMAL(10,3),
    created_at INTEGER,
    keys_json TEXT,
    hive_price_snapshot DECIMAL(10,3)
);
```

## Running the Service

Development mode with auto-reload:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Production mode:
```bash
npm start
```

## Security Considerations

- The service includes safety limits for HIVE amounts
- Username validation before account creation
- Secure storage of pending account information
- Transaction verification through blockchain confirmations
- Price fluctuation protection with snapshots
